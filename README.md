## Assignment covering topics from chapters 5 and 6.

## Technologies Used:

- GitHub

- Python

## Description:

Question 1 takes the function given in the question and uses Euler's Method to calculate the approximate value of the equation. It also takes the given range, iterations, and initial point in order to compute this.

Question 2 is similar to question one in that it takes the function given and uses the Runge-Kutta Method to calculate the approximate value of the equation. It also needs the range, iterations, and initial point to be calculated.

Question 3 takes the given matrix and uses Gaussian elimination and backward substitution to find the solution to the matrix, but then takes that answer and puts it into augmented matrix form.

Question 4 takes the given matrix and uses LU factorization to find the determinant, the L matrix (lower matrix), and the U matrix (upper matrix).

Question 5 takes the given matrix and determines whether it is diagonally dominant by printing True or False.

Question 6 takes the given matrix and determines whether it is positive definite by printing True or False.

## Set Up / Installation:

- Create a requirements.txt. This can be done by typing into the terminal "pip freeze > requirements.txt".

- Install numpy by typing into the terminal "pip install numpy". However, if this is already installed, you may not need to install again.

- At the top of the program it is necessary to import the "numpy" library for this.

- In the command line, enter "python assignment_3.py" and then hit ENTER to run.
